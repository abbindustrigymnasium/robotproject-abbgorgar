This is my arduino project for a robot car, which can go through a labyrinth.

## Files
* Solid works files are in the map called _**SOLIDWORKS**_.

* Functions are described in diagram in the file _**RobotBil Sekvensschema.vsd**_.
* MQTT files are in the folder called _**MQTT**_.
* Video with explanations is _** **_.

## Help

To be able to use arduino code you must install libraries in arduino. Names of libraries are in arduino code.
For MQTT you must install _**node modules**_, _**mosca**_ and _**nodemon**_.
